# Software-Engineering

#Team:
-a group of professionals organized in order to complete the task of creating a large software project

##Structures

- Democratic 
- Hierarchical or chief programmer
-Team manager/team leader 
-Synchronize and stabilize team
-Agile teams

##Democratic Team

-Group of up to 10 programmers
-Equal partnership with egoless programming
-works well if the group is small, highly competent
-Problem with who is in charge
-positive attitude about finding fault
-First descrive by weinber in 1971
if programmer sees program as extension of his ego, programmer will be less apt to find all the faults in his own code
-with "egoless programmin" ever programmer must encourabe the fining of faults in his wown
-what is important is team identitiy and mutual respect


##analysis of the arrpoach

-major advantage = positive attitud towas the finding of faults.
-weinberg feels that egoless teams spring up spontaneously and cannot be imposed from outside
-enormously productive.
-work best when the problem is difficult
-should function well in a research environment
-works well in an industrial setting when there is a hard problem to solve


##Hierarchical or Chief programmer Team
-one overall manager (cheif programmer)
-everyone understands the lines of authority
-Team members tend to participate less in decisions likely to be handed down from above
-May have a programming secretary and a backup programmer for the chief programmer 
-Difficult to find one person adept at both managing and programming
