##Democratic Team

-Group of up to 10 programmers
-Equal partnership with egoless programming
-works well if the group is small, highly competent
-Problem with who is in charge
-positive attitude about finding fault
-First descrive by weinber in 1971
if programmer sees program as extension of his ego, programmer will be less apt to find all the faults in his own code
-with "egoless programmin" ever programmer must encourabe the fining of faults in his wown
-what is important is team identitiy and mutual respect
