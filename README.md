# Software-Engineering

#Team:
- a group of professionals organized in order to complete the task of creating a large software project

##Structures

- Democratic 
- Hierarchical or chief programmer
- Team manager/team leader 
- Synchronize and stabilize team
- Agile teams

##Democratic Team

- Group of up to 10 programmers
- Equal partnership with egoless programming
- works well if the group is small, highly competent
- Problem with who is in charge
- positive attitude about finding fault
- First descrive by weinber in 1971
- if programmer sees program as extension of his ego, programmer will be less apt to find all the faults in his own code
- with "egoless programmin" ever programmer must encourabe the fining of faults in his wown
- what is important is team identitiy and mutual respect


##analysis of the arrpoach

- major advantage = positive attitud towas the finding of faults.
- weinberg feels that egoless teams spring up spontaneously and cannot be imposed from outside
- enormously productive.
- work best when the problem is difficult
- should function well in a research environment
- works well in an industrial setting when there is a hard problem to solve


##Hierarchical or Chief programmer Team
- one overall manager (cheif programmer)
- everyone understands the lines of authority
- Team members tend to participate less in decisions likely to be handed down from above
- May have a programming secretary and a backup programmer for the chief programmer 
- Difficult to find one person adept at both managing and programming

##chief programmer Team
Two key aspect of a chief programming team:

1. specializtion: each member of the team carries out only those taks for which he or she has been trained.
2. hierarchy chief programmer directs the actions of all the other members of the team and is responsible for every aspect of the operation

Chief programming team concept formalized by mill (19720
chief prgrammer: both a successful manager and a highly skilled programmer who does the archtetural design and any critical or complex sections of the code and hadles all interfacing

###duties of chief programmer

- successful manager and highly skilled programmer
- does the architectrual design
- allocates coding among the team members
- While the critical (or complex sections of the code
- handles all the interfactin issues
- reviews the work of the other team members
- is prsonally responsible for every line of code

###more on chief programmer team
- back-up programmer must be as competent as the chief programmer in every respect and must know as much about the project as the chief programmer
    - does black-box test case planning
    - work on the detailed design and the coding under the direction of the chief programmer
- programming secretary (sometime called librarian) responsible for maintaining the project production library, the documentation of the project which includes source code listings, JCL, and test data.
- Responsible for conversion of source code to machine readable form, compilaiton, linking, loading, execution, andrunning test cases
- One to three programmers work on the detailed design and the coding under the direction of the chief programmer and hand their source code to the secretary

####review of chief programmer
- if the chief programmer is competent, then the chief programmer team organization works well
- Chances of finding a chief programmer are small
- qualifies needed to be a highly skilled programmer are different from those needed to be a successful manager
