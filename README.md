# Software-Engineering

#Team:
- a group of professionals organized in order to complete the task of creating a large software project

##Structures
- Democratic 
- Hierarchical or chief programmer
- Team manager/team leader 
- Synchronize and stabilize team
- Agile teams

##Democratic Team
- Group of up to 10 programmers
- Equal partnership with egoless programming
- works well if the group is small, highly competent
- Problem with who is in charge
- positive attitude about finding fault
- First descrive by weinber in 1971
- if programmer sees program as extension of his ego, programmer will be less apt to find all the faults in his own code
- with "egoless programmin" ever programmer must encourabe the fining of faults in his wown
- what is important is team identitiy and mutual respect


###Analysis of the arrpoach
- major advantage = positive attitude towards the finding of faults.
- weinberg feels that egoless teams spring up spontaneously and cannot be imposed from outside
- enormously productive.
- work best when the problem is difficult
- should function well in a research environment
- works well in an industrial setting when there is a hard problem to solve


##Hierarchical or Chief programmer Team
- one overall manager (cheif programmer)
- everyone understands the lines of authority
- Team members tend to participate less in decisions likely to be handed down from above
- May have a programming secretary and a backup programmer for the chief programmer 
- Difficult to find one person adept at both managing and programming

###Chief programmer Team
Two key aspect of a chief programming team:

1. specializtion: each member of the team carries out only those taks for which he or she has been trained.
2. hierarchy chief programmer directs the actions of all the other members of the team and is responsible for every aspect of the operation

Chief programming team concept formalized by mill (19720
chief prgrammer: both a successful manager and a highly skilled programmer who does the archtetural design and any critical or complex sections of the code and hadles all interfacing

###Duties of chief programmer
- successful manager and highly skilled programmer
- does the architectrual design
- allocates coding among the team members
- While the critical (or complex sections of the code
- handles all the interfactin issues
- reviews the work of the other team members
- is prsonally responsible for every line of code

###More on chief programmer team
- back-up programmer must be as competent as the chief programmer in every respect and must know as much about the project as the chief programmer
    - does black-box test case planning
    - work on the detailed design and the coding under the direction of the chief programmer
- programming secretary (sometime called librarian) responsible for maintaining the project production library, the documentation of the project which includes source code listings, JCL, and test data.
- Responsible for conversion of source code to machine readable form, compilaiton, linking, loading, execution, andrunning test cases
- One to three programmers work on the detailed design and the coding under the direction of the chief programmer and hand their source code to the secretary

####Review of chief programmer
- if the chief programmer is competent, then the chief programmer team organization works well
- Chances of finding a chief programmer are small
- qualifies needed to be a highly skilled programmer are different from those needed to be a successful manager
- backup programmer must ahve the same qualities and are just as rare
- must also take a back sear tothe chief programmer
- programming secretary must be a programmer who does not mind lots of paperwor

##Team manager/Team leader
- split the responsibilities of the chief programmer into a team manager and a team leader
- The team manager handles the nontechnical management
- The team leader deals with the technical issues of the project
- Results in programmers having 2 "bosses"
- May be difficult to determine if an issue is technical or nontechnical
- one project leader oversees several team leaders
- Each team leader has several programmers for which she/he is responsible
- Clear lines of communication

##Synchronize-and-Stabilize Team
- used by microsoft
- small team led by a manager and having three to eight developers and three to eight testers working ont-to-one with the developers
- Developers are given freedom to design and implement their portions as they wish
- each day the partial components are tested and debugged
- encourages creativity and innovation yet the daily synchroniztion keeps the project on track

##Agile Teams
- Work in pairs
- Provide instant review
- Create test cases which are used for daily testing
- Remove the problem if one developer leaves,  the knowledge does not disappear about a portion of the project

##Choosing an appropriate team organiztion
- there is no one solution to the problem of team organiztion
- The "correct" way depends on
    - the product
    - the outlook of the leaders of the organizatioin
    - previous experience with various team structures
- exceedingly little research has been done on software team organization
    - instead team organiztion has been based on research on group dynamics in general
- Without relevant experimental results, it is hard to determine optional team organization for a specific product
