        * System experience
        * Experience with similar applications
        * Eductaion
        * Reading level
        * typing skill
    2. physical characteristics
        1. Age
        2. gender
        3. handedness
        4. physical handicap
    3. characteristics of user's taks and jobs
        1. type of use(discretionary/mandatory)
        2. frequency of use
        3. turnover rate for employees

2. understand the purpose of the user interface in terms of the applications overall purpose.
3. understand the principles of good screen design
    1. consistency among screens
    2. anticipate where the user will usually start
    3. apply a hierarchy to emphasize order of importance
    4. apply principles of pleasing visuals ( balance, symmetry, regularity, predictability, simplicity, unit, proportion, economy)

    1. property window 
    2. dialog window
    3. message window
    4. palete window
    5. pop-up window
5. develop system menus
    1. provide a main menu (between 5 and 9)
    2. display all  relecant alternatives
    3. match the menu structure to the structure of teh application's tasks
    4. minimize number of menu levels
6. select the appropriate device-based controls (the physical means by which the user communicates their desires with the application joysticks, trackballs, graphics tablet, touch screens, mouses, microphones and keyboards)
7. select the appropriate screen-based controls (icons, buttons, text boxes, radio buttons) between 5 and 9 or organized into groups

### Case tools for requirements
* graphical tool for drawing data flow diagrams
    * easier to change a diagram stored in CASE tool than to redraw
    * Details of teh product are stored in the CASE tool so the documentation is always available and updated
    * Not always user friendly
    * Almost impossible to program computer to draw as pleasing a diagram as a human
    * expensive 


### Other case tools for requirements
* text editor
* Survey construction tool
* Screen generator (for rapid prototype)

### challenges of the requirements phase
* employees of teh client organization often feel threatened by computerization
* The requirements team members must be able to negotiate
    * the client's needs may have to be scaled down
* Key employees of the client organization may not have the time for essential in-depth discussions
* Flexibility and objectivity are essential
